# The Office: An American Workplace
- This is a site that is awesome.
- It served as a way to kind of get my coding/development chops back after a long period of distraction by way of Nintendo Switch and all its' glory (mainly Breath of the Wild, Stardew Valley, Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2.. Basically everything.
- Inspired by my love for the show, and mine and my wife's fourth rewatch!
- Created with HTML, CSS and Skeleton.css framework!

* Side note: It's already done, just uploading for archival purposes.. Next couple of projects will be Github'd out.
